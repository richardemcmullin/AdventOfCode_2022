# AdventOfCode_2022
My java solutions to the https://adventofcode.com/ advent calendar for 2022.
<p>
Each day is in its own package.
<p>
All days (except day01) follow the standard solver template:
<dl>
  <dt>readInput</dt>
  <dd>- read and parse all input from the console</dd>
  <dt>solvePart1</dt>
  <dd>- solve the first part of the day's puzzle</dd>
  <dt>solvePart2</dt>
  <dd>- solve the second part of the day's puzzle</dd>
</dl>
The time taken to solve each part of the puzzle is printed 
on the console as well as the solution.
